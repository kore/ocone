===================
Legatimacy of oCone
===================

The issue
=========

The software itself will of course not be illegal, by using only open source
libraries and ensuring clean IP of the code. But some local authorities
consider software only (or mostly) used for illegal actions as illegal. It
will be simple to violate copyright laws using oCone clients by offering 
website content without authorization of the copyright owner. By the design of
oCone it will be impossible to ban such requests.

Legal use
=========

oCone is build to provide load balancing for free available content by peer to
peer caching. The restructured data will reference the contents license and
the original author and only offer another channel for the content to be
transferred.

Growing projects like wikipedia suffer from high load and look for
distribution methods, which do not require expensive server setups. oCone is
designed to help here.

Preventing from illegal use
===========================

The scripting engine used to fetch content is turing complete, so that it will
be impossible to limit the use of oCone to a subset of functions allowed by
the copyright in a special country.

oCone will offer whitelist of scripts which tries to respect a reasonable set 
of common copyright laws. oCone can not prevent users from loading other
whitelistis distributed over random channels in the internet containing scripts
violating copyright laws. Defined filters could easily be modified in an open
source sofware, so that it would make no sense to implement them in the first
place.
