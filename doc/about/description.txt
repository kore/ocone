The name
========

The name oCone derivates from "Open Content Network" and shows the goal of
oCone to build up a network of free and open available content.

The goal
========

The worlds evolution mainly bases on information, or content. The internet
shows a fantastic infrastructure to publish content and make it available for
everyone in the world, but it has some draw backs.

Content is normally published using HTML (or XHTML) which only describes
visible formats and does not structure the content in a sensible semantical
way. Even there are a lot of initiatives to change this it will take some time
to update / transform all content. There are some persons who say that they are 
a lot of companies and persons who do not even want their content to be really
readable.

The infrastructure of the internet is pretty stable but the number of users
and potential hits on a single website caused by famous news sites requires
expensive infrastructures to serve those. This is something only big 
institutions or comapanies can afford.

oCone tries to solve this by building a peer to peer network, where each peer
can grab content from the web (if allowed), transform it into semantic XML and
offer it to the other peers. In a network each peer will cache the requested
contents and will reduce the load on the requested sites this way. With enough
capacity in the peers caches oCone will even be able to mirror complete
webpages for use in networks not connected with the internet, or serve content
for websites which are offline during the request.
