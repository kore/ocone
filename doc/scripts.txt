oCone script specifications
===========================

The scripts
===========

Scripts are used to fetch textual content from websites or other locations and
generate XML documents from them.

Definition document
===================

Scripts should deliver a definition document specifying the structure of the
generated content. For the XML specification you could either use XSD, DTD or
RelaxNG. The definition will be used as the namespace for all child elements
of the content node.

Naming scheme
=============

The scripts need unique names to be uniquely identified in the network. To
enable structuring the scripts in the UI we choose a USENet like naming
scheme. The topmost defines the type of content, followed by meaningful names.
The grammar for names:

NAME = TYPE '.' MULTIPLE
MULTIPLE = ( SINGLE | SINGLE '.' MULTIPLE )
TYPE = ( org | com | gov | ? )
SINGLE = [a-z]+

Example: org.wikipedia.article

Script context
==============

In the scripts we need access to DOM operations on the XML file to generate
and different parsing libraries to transform the fetched content.

As the initial structure the script will receive its parameters and a basic
XML document with a filled header and an empty content element. The purpose is
of course filling the content node or bailing out with an error.
