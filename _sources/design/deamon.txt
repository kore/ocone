Design of oCone deamon
======================

Main threads
============

The main process off the oCone deamon contains several logic threads managing 
parts of the software.

- Executing scripts to fetch and transform data
- Answering cache requests for peers
- Requesting cache content from peers
- Answering client requests
- GUI communication

Interthread communication
=========================

For the interthread communication and synchronization we need several
datastructures containing the open requests.

- Scripts to execute
  - Notification on finished script to client thread
- Cache requests
  - Notification to peer request thread
  - Notification to client request thread

Datastructures in threads
=========================

- Peer list
  - Address
  - Statistics
  - Priority

- Cache
  - Script reference
  - File

- Script tree
  - Cached
  - Last request from

- Configuration
  ...
