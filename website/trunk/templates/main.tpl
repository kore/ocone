			<h2>The name</h2>
			<p>
			The name oCone derivates from "Open Content Network" and shows the goal of
			oCone to build up a network of free and open available content.
			</p>

			<h2>The goal</h2>
			<p>
			The worlds evolution mainly bases on information, or content. The internet
			shows a fantastic infrastructure to publish content and make it available for 
			everyone in the world, but it has some draw backs.
			</p><p>
			Content is normally published using HTML (or XHTML) which only describes
			visible formats and does not structure the content in a senseful semantical
			way. Even there are a lot of initiatives to change this it will take some time
			to update / transform all content. There are some persons who say that they are 
			a lot of companies and persons who do not even want their content to be really
			readable.
			</p><p>
			The infrastructure of the internet is pretty stable but the number of users
			and potential hits on a single website caused by famous news sites requires
			expensive infrastructures to serve those. This is something only big 
			institutions or comapanies can afford.
			</p><p>
			oCone tries to solve this by building a peer to peer network, where each peer
			can grab content from the web (if allowed), transform it into semantic XML and 
			offer it to the other peers. In a network each peer will cache the requested
			contents and will reduce the load on the requested sites this way. With enough
			capacity in the peers caches oCone will even be able to mirror complete
			webpages for use in networks not connected with the internet, or serve content
			for websites which are offline during the request.
